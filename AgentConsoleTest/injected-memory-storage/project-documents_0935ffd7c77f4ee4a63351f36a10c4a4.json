Make several perceptual maps using di\u0000erent\naxis attributes\nMake more than one map? Why?\u00A0\nMaking perceptual maps is easy - right? Probably... but using perceptual maps\neffectively so that they become powerful and insightful analytical tools is a\nlittle trickier.\u00A0\nIn this guide you will \u0000nd the seven rules for perceptual map best practice, to\nensure that you are getting the most from this simple, yet helpful, marketing\npositioning tool.\nBecause a key aspect of perceptual map is to analyze and understand the\nmarket. If we pick two attributes and only have one map, then we are\nimposing  of the market onto the \u0000nal map and we are not guided\nby the perception of consumers.\nour view\nThat\u0027s not the intention of a map. Nobody really cares what we think as an\nindividual (or as a marketer), but they do care what the market thinks. By\nlooking at different maps by using a variety of attributes, we will discover a\nlot more about the marketplace and its consumers.\nPerceptual Maps: Best Practice - Perceptual Maps 4 Marketing\nPage 2\nPerceptual Maps: Best Practice - Perceptual Maps 4 Marketing\nLet\u2019s compare the following two perceptual maps \u2013 they are both for the soft\ndrink market. The \u0000rst map uses the attributes of fun/serious image and\nsweet/not sweet taste, while the second map (on the next page) uses the\nattributes of high/no sugar content and strong/no caffeine.\u00A0\u00A0\nAnd, as you can see, the positioning of the\u00A0 brands differs in both maps.\nPerceptual Maps: Best Practice - Perceptual Maps 4 Marketing\nPage 3\nPerceptual Maps: Best Practice - Perceptual Maps 4 Marketing\nWhich one is better? Well, they are both useful and give you some insight\ninto the market, consumer perception, and competitor intent \u2013 but the more\nhelpful map is the one that uses the key attributes that we are positioning\nour brand upon (provided that these attributes are important to consumers\nin their decision-making and purchase choice).\n2nd perceptual map, but with di\u0000erent attributes\nPerceptual Maps: Best Practice - Perceptual Maps 4 Marketing\nPage 4\nPerceptual Maps: Best Practice - Perceptual Maps 4 Marketing\n2. Use determinant attributes for the map \u2013 not the\nmost important attributes\nA determinant attribute is the product feature or bene\u0000t that determines the\n\u0000nal choice between competing brands \u2013 and it may not be a signi\u0000cant\nattribute.\nFor example, we may choose an airline for a long \u0000ight because they have\nmore in-\u0000ight food choices. This then becomes the determinant attribute.\nCheck out this ad for Air New Zealand \u2013 they are promoting the quality of\ntheir in-\u0000ight food. How do you choose between competing and similar\npriced airlines?\nPerceptual Maps: Best Practice - Perceptual Maps 4 Marketing\nPage 5\nPerceptual Maps: Best Practice - Perceptual Maps 4 Marketing\n3. Make di\u0000erent maps for di\u0000erent market\nsegments\nMarket segments have their own needs, preferences, and perceptions \u2013 that\nwhy we have undertaken the segmentation process. So, where possible, it is a\ngreat idea to construct a perceptual map which shows each segment\u2019s view of\nthe market and the competitors.\nMarketing plans are typically built around target markets \u2013 so our perceptual\nmaps should take the same view. Whatever your segmentation approach,\nmake sure that you produce maps that re\u0000ect the perception of your target\nmarkets \u2013 not the view of the overall market (or average consumer).\n4. Include both key and indirect competitors\nWe tend to usually only include our direct competitors in our maps. This is\nbecause they are top-of-mind to us as marketers.\nHowever, is that how consumers think? For example, is a consumer\nconsidering going to McDonalds for lunch only choosing between fast food\noptions, or are they thinking about grabbing a snack, a coffee, or even making\nfood at home?\nPerceptual Maps: Best Practice - Perceptual Maps 4 Marketing\nPage 6\nPerceptual Maps: Best Practice - Perceptual Maps 4 Marketing\nCheck out the next two perceptual maps \u2013 the \u0000rst one shows indirect\ncompetitors (or substitute products). The color codes show the direct\ncompetitors and we can also drill down to those brands in the second map\n(shown on the next page).\nLooking at\nindirect\ncompetitors is\nextremely\nuseful, as\noften these\nalternate\nproduct\ncategories\npose the\nbiggest\ncompetitive\nrisk.\u00A0\nIn mature markets, market shares tend to be relatively stable due to brand\nloyalty and established and somewhat repetitive consumer behavior. But new\nplayers and substitute products can have a major, and sometime disruptive\nimpact on the market and change consumer behavior.\nPerceptual Maps: Best Practice - Perceptual Maps 4 Marketing\nPage 7\nPerceptual Maps: Best Practice - Perceptual Maps 4 Marketing\n5. Use time-based perceptual maps\nPerceptions change over time because brands develop, competitors evolve,\nnew players enter the market, and even consumer needs change in the long-\nterm.\nThat\u2019s why, where possible, we should also map the position of key brands\nlast year to see how they have evolved. This approach will provide valuable\ninsight into competitors and their likely marketing strategy.\nPerceptual Maps: Best Practice - Perceptual Maps 4 Marketing\nPage 8\nPerceptual Maps: Best Practice - Perceptual Maps 4 Marketing\nIn this simple perceptual map, you can see that our \u0000rm (US) is now in a\nmuch stronger place than our key competitor (THEM) on a before and after\nposition.\u00A0\nAlthough this is quite a simple map, it is a powerful piece of communication\nto demonstrate that our positioning strategies are working well.\nPerceptual Maps: Best Practice - Perceptual Maps 4 Marketing\nPage 9\nPerceptual Maps: Best Practice - Perceptual Maps 4 Marketing\nThe top-right corner of the map is not always the best positioning approach,\nnor it is always achievable. When setting long-term positioning goals, be\nrealistic about what is possible, especially if our competitors have similar\nplans!\nHere is the map that Steve Jobs used when launching the \u0000rst iPhone in\n2007. Apply went straight for the top right hand corner as a later entrant into\nthe smart phone\nmarket. And, for\nthem, it was a huge\nsuccess and\ntransformed Apple\ninto one of the\nmost successful\n\u0000rms in the world.\nBut\u2026 most \u0000rms\nare not Apple. They\ndo not have their\nlevel of innovation,\nskills, resources, and brand equity \u2013 so, unfortunately, for most \u0000rms we\nneed to be a little less ambitious and a little more realistic in most cases.\n6. Be realistic about positioning goals\nPerceptual Maps: Best Practice - Perceptual Maps 4 Marketing\nPage 10\nPerceptual Maps: Best Practice - Perceptual Maps 4 Marketing\n7. Never put price and quality on the same map\nAs a marketing lecturer, I know that this is a common map con\u0000guration\nprovided by students. But it is a quite unhelpful map.\nAs you can see in this\nmap, the brands are\nmapped in a diagonal\npattern. This means that\nthe two axis dimensions\nare strongly correlated in\nthe mind of the\nconsumer. When this\nhappens, look to replace\none of the attributes in\nthe map to provide more\ninsight.\nWhy? Because consumers usually connect price and quality in their minds,\nespecially for product categories that they lack experience with. This means\nthat you will end up with a highly correlated map, as essentially you are\nmapping the same attribute twice.\nPerceptual Maps: Best Practice - Perceptual Maps 4 Marketing\nPage 11\nPerceptual Maps: Best Practice - Perceptual Maps 4 Marketing\nTools and Resources\nTo make a map quickly and easily, get our Free Download Excel Template for\nPerceptual Maps - available at PerceptualMaps.com\nAnd if you need to review and analyze dozens, or even 100\u2019s, of different\nmaps following a brand image survey, then check out our Premium Fast\nMapping Excel Template \u2013 where you can review lots of map really fast!\nAlso available at PerceptualMaps.com\nAnd if you want to take your maps to the next level and map multiple\nattributes\n(not just tow\nattributes)\nat the same\ntime, along\nwith all the\ncompeting\nbrands (like\nshown in\nthis map) \u2013\nthen check out our Multi-Dimensional Map Excel Template.\nPerceptual Maps:\u00A0\nBest Practice\nFor lots more information and free Excel\ntemplates, come visit us at...\nwww.perceptualmaps.com\nHelping marketers make perceptual maps\nsince 2013","MimeType":"application/pdf","FileSize":550924,"ExtractedTextLength":8361,"UploadedAt":"2025-10-13T13:44:53.3672675Z","LastAccessed":"2025-10-13T13:44:53.3672675Z","Description":"Test PDF document"}]
